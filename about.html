        Pink Floyd, British rock band at the forefront of 1960s psychedelia who
        later popularized the concept album for mass rock audiences in the
        1970s. The principal members were lead guitarist Syd Barrett (original
        name Roger Keith Barrett; b. January 6, 1946, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire,
        England—d. July 7, 2006, Cambridge), bassist Roger Waters (b. September
        6, 1943, Great Bookham, Surrey), drummer Nick Mason (b. January 27,
        1945, Birmingham, West Midlands), keyboard player Rick Wright (in full
        Richard Wright; b. July 28, 194 London—d. September 15, 2008, London),
        and guitarist David Gilmour (b. March 6, 1944, Cambridge).

        Formed in 1965, the band went through several name changes before
        combining the first names of a pair of Carolina bluesmen, Pink Anderson
        and Floyd Council. Their initial direction came from
        vocalist-guitarist-songwriter Barrett, whose mixture of blues, music
        hall styles, Lewis Carroll references, and dissonant psychedelia
        established the band as a cornerstone of the British underground scene.
        They signed with EMI and early in 1967 had their first British hit with
        the controversial “Arnold Layne,” a song about a transvestite. This was
        followed by their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, a lush,
        experimental record that has since become a rock classic. Their sound
        was becoming increasingly adventurous, incorporating sound effects,
        spacy guitar and keyboards, and extended improvisation such as
        “Interstellar Overdrive.”

        By 1968 Barrett, who had overused LSD and was struggling with
        schizophrenia, was replaced by guitarist Gilmour. Without Barrett’s
        striking lyrics, the band moved away from the singles market to
        concentrate on live work, continuing its innovations in sound and
        lighting but with varying degrees of success. After recording a series
        of motion-picture soundtrack albums, they entered the American charts
        with Atom Heart Mother (1970) and Meddle (1971). Making records that
        were song-based but thematic in approach and that included long
        instrumental passages, the band did much to popularize the concept
        album. They hit the commercial jackpot with Dark Side of the Moon
        (1973). A bleak treatise on death and emotional breakdown underlined by
        Waters’s dark songwriting, it sent Pink Floyd soaring into the megastar
        bracket and remained in the American pop charts for more than a decade.
        The follow-up, Wish You Were Here (1975), included “Shine On You Crazy
        Diamond,” a song for Barrett, and, though it went to number one in both
        the United States and Britain, it was considered anticlimactic and
        pompous by many critics.
